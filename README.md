copycore
========

This is a library mod which is required for some of my other mods such as [Advanced
Health Options](https://github.com/copygirl/AdvHealthOptions). It provides many utility
classes and methods which can be used by multiple different mods, mainly to ease
development and to make pretty code. It doesn't come with many functions on its own,
though that might change in the future.

### Features ###

  Pulls items from the column above when stack is used up or tool breaks.
